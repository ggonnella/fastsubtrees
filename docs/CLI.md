# Command line interface

The command line interface of the library consists in a script ``fastsubtrees``
that can be used to construct and modify a tree, add attributes to nodes, and
query subtree IDs and attribute values.

The list of subcommands is displayed using ``fastsubtrees --help``.
Using ``--help`` after a subcommand (e.g. ``fastsubtrees construct --help``
displays the syntax and details of the subcommand.

There are two sets of subcommands. For working with the tree itself,
the corresponding verb (construct, query, add, delete) is used as subcommand
directly. For working with attributes (see below), the subcommand is
``attr`` and the verb (construct, query, add, delete) is used as sub-subcommand,
after attr (e.g. ``fastsubtrees attr query``).

The following subcommands are available:
```
  construct         Construct the tree data structure and save it to file
  query             List the IDs of the subtree under a given node
  add               Add new nodes to an existing tree data structure
  delete            Remove nodes from an existing tree data structure
  attr construct    Save values of an attribute to (some of the) nodes of a tree
  attr query        List the values of an attribute in a given subtree
  attr add          Add additional attribute values for more nodes of a tree
  attr delete       Delete some or all values of an attribute
```

## Tree construction

The subcommand ``fastsubtrees construct`` constructs the tree representation
from a tabular file.

The script has different modes of use, depending on the input format,
as described in the following subsections.

Common to all modes of use is the first parameter, which is the output file
name, containing the tree data, used for the subsequent queries.

### NCBI taxonomy tree construction

For constructing the NCBI taxonomy tree, the directory containing ``nodes.dmp``
is specified, after using the ``--ntdump`` option.
Example:
```
fastsubtrees-construct my.tree --ntdump ntdumpsdir
```

### Using a tabular file

If the input data is contained in a TAB-separated input file, with two
columns, the elements IDs in the first column, and the parent IDs in the second
column, then the ``--tab`` option can be used:

Example:
```
fastsubtrees-construct my.tree --tab elems_and_parents.tsv
```

If the separator is not TAB, or the column order is different, use the generic
tree construction mode described below,
passing the ``ids_from_tabular_file.py`` module.

### Generic tree construction mode

In the generic mode, the next parameter of ``fastsubtrees construct``
is the name of a Python module. This must define a function called
``element_parent_ids()``, which yields pairs of IDs ``(element_id, parent_id)``.
Examples of this functions, obtaining the ID data from a database table or
from a tabular file are given in the modules in the
``fastsubtrees.ids_modules`` namespace modules.

The ``element_parent_ids()`` function usually needs parameters. These
can be passed either as positional or as keyword parameters. To pass them
as positional parameters, they are just used as further arguments,
after the module name. To define them as keyword parameters, the
``--keyargs`` option is used, and all further arguments in the form
``key=value`` (i.e. where at least one = is present), are parsed and
passed as keywords parameters.

Examples:
```
fastsubtrees construct my.tree my_module.py a b c
fastsubtrees construct my.tree my_module.py --keyargs k1=v1 k2=v=2 x
```

In the first example, the function in ``my_module.py`` is called as
``element_parent_ids("a", "b", "c")``, in the second as
``element_parent_ids("x", k1="v1", k2="v=2")``.

Some modules implementing the described interface are provided
under ``fastsubtrees/ids_modules``. In particular, ``ids_from_database.py``
provides an interface for reading the tree data from a database table,
and ``ids_from_tabular_file.py`` from a tabular input file.

## Modifying an existing tree representation

### Adding a subtree

The script `fastsubtrees add` adds one or multiple nodes to an already
existing tree. The interface is identical to the generic tree construction
interface of ``fastsubtrees construct`` (see above), i.e. the following
arguments are passed to the script:
- `tree`: File containing the tree that has to be updated.
- `idsmod`: A Python module that defines the function ``element_parent_ids()``,
   which optionally takes arguments (``<idsmod_data>``) and which yields pairs
   of IDs for all nodes ``(element_id, parent_id)`` of the subtree to be added.
- `idsmod_data` (optional): list of arguments to be passed to
  ``element_parent_ids()``. By default they are passed as positional arguments.
  To pass keyword arguments, using the syntax ``key=value``, use the option
  ``--keyargs``.

### Deleting a subtree

The script `fastsubtrees delete` is used to delete one or multiple
nodes from an exiting tree representation. If the specified node is a leaf
node, then only that node it is deleted. If it is an internal node, then the
entire subtree is also deleted, i.e. the set of all the descendants of the
specified node.

The following parameters are used for the script:
- `nodeid`: ID of a leaf node to be deleted, or of an internal node, i.e.
   the subtree root of the subtree to be deleted
- `tree`: File containing the tree

## Tree attributes

The tree can contain further information, except the IDs, in the form of
attributes. Attribute values can be integers, floats or strings.
Not all nodes will necessarily have an attribute value associated
with them. Some nodes can contain multiple values for an attribute.

### Adding an attribute

The script `fastsubtrees attr construct` constructs a file containing
the values of a specified attribute for the nodes of the tree.

In order to generate attribute files, the user has to always
provide the following parameters:
- `tree`: File containing the tree that has to be updated.
- `attribute`: Name of the attribute
- `attrmod`: Path to a python module that defines a function
  ``attribute_values()`` which may take arguments (``<attrmod_data>``) and
  returns pairs ``(element_id, attribute_value)`` for each node to which an
  attribute value exists.
- `attrmod_data`: This is an optional parameter. It consists of a list of
  arguments to be passed to the ``attribute_values()`` function of the module
  specified as **attrmod**. By default they are passed as positional arguments.
  To pass keyword arguments, the syntax **key=value** and the option
  **--keyargs** has to be used.

A module using the described ``attrmod`` interface for adding attributes
from tabular files is provided under ``fastsubtrees/ids_modules`` and
can be selected by the shorthand option ``--tab``:
```
fastsubtrees attr construct my.tree myattribute --tab tabularfile.tsv
```
By default, the IDs are supposed to be in column 0, the attribute values in
column 1 and the columns to be tab-separated; different values can be
provided as keyword arguments, e.g.:
```
fastsubtrees attr construct my.tree myattribute --tab tabularfile.tsv \
   --keyargs id_col=2 attr_col=10 separator=';'
```

### Attributes when editing a tree

If attribute have been defined, as described in the following section,
the attribute files are automatically detected and modified too,
when adding or deleting a subtree.

When adding a subtree, the attribute will initially have an empty value (None)
for each of the additional nodes. In order to add attribute values for the new
nodes, ``fastsubtrees attr add`` is employed. This must be called
for each of the attributes for which values shall be added, and uses the same
interface as ``fastsubtrees attr construct`` (see above).

### Editing attribute values

To add new values for an attribute, ``fastsubtrees attr add`` is used. It
offers the same interface as ``fastsubtrees attr construct`` (see above).

By default, the new values of the attributes for a node are added to the
existing ones. If the existing ones shall be replaced by the new ones,
use the option ``--replace``.

To remove the values of an attribute for a list of given nodes,
use ``fastsubtrees attr delete``.

### Removing an attribute

To remove an attribute, use ``fastsubtrees attr delete``.
with the option ``--all``.

## Subtree queries

### Querying node identifiers

The subcommand ``fastsubtrees query`` loads a tree representation from file
and performs a subtree IDs query to return a list of IDs of the subtree under a
given node.

To run the query, two parameters are required:
- `tree`: File containing the tree. It is the output of
  **fastsubtrees construct** (eventually modified by other subcommands).
- `subtreeroot`: ID of the root of the subtree for which the IDs
                 have to be queried

## Querying attribute values

For query the values of an attribute in a subtree,
``fastsubtrees attr query`` is used.

Three parameters are mandatory to run the query:
- `tree`: File containing the tree. It is the output of
  **fastsubtrees construct** (eventually modified by other subcommands).
- `attribute`: Name of the attribute to query
- `subtreeroot`: ID of the root of the subtree for which the values
                 have to be queried

By default, only the attribute values are displayed, one node per line,
only for nodes for which at least one value exists.
To display the node ID alongside the values, use the option ``--ids``.
To display also the results (``None``) also for nodes for which no
value exists, use the option ``--nones``.
