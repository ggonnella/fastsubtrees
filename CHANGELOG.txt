=== 2.2 ==
- exposed to API method for navigating up the tree
- added methods for reading attribute values for a node
- added method for finding ancestors for a node with a given attribute value

=== 2.1 ==
- parallel option for the construction of the tree
- slight performance improvement by validating parents before subtree size calculation

=== 2.0 ===
- tree construction: removed performance bottleneck
- tree update/subtree move and reset operations
- CLI: simplified to 'tree', 'attribute' and 'query' commands
- API: aligned to the CLI, by moving code from the commands to the API
- test suite: expanded to complete code coverage
- README: reorganized and made examples with working with tax names and using NtSubtree
- node 0 is now allowed
- subpackage 'ntsubtree' automatically downloads and constructs the NCBI taxonomy tree
- ntsubtree simplifies working with taxonomic names and keeping the data up-to-date
- Github CI Action linting and testing
- documentation is now available at ReadTheDocs

=== 1.7 ===
- genomes_attributes_viewer is now a Python package, installable by pip
- separated ntdownload from ntmirror, to ease installation when MariaDB is not available
- updated the documentation
- updated the Docker image/scripts to recent changes

=== 1.6.1 ===
- fix packaging: added missing __init__.py to commands subdir

=== 1.6 ===
- single CLI tool with subcommands
- added --tab option to simplify operation with tabular file as input source
- improved the CLI documentation, added examples
- improved the output of the attr query tool

=== 1.5 ===
- do not automatically install ntmirror, which is only required for benchmarks
and the example application; this avoids to create a dependency to mariadb
and thus allows simpler installation using pip
- rewrite the Docker image
- tests, benchmarks and example app can be started using a simpler syntax

=== 1.4 ===
- add scripts to modify attribute values and adding values after add-subtree
- improved the documentation
- distribute with package also module for attribute construction from tab files
- fix a bug in subtree sizes after subtree insertions
- test CLI tools

=== 1.3 ===
- simplify scripts CLI interface

=== 1.2.1 ===
- make sure ids_modules is included in the package by adding a __init__.py

=== 1.2 ===
- docker image providing tests, benchmarks and example app
- tests divided into multiple files and using fixtures
- benchmarks: scripts provided to replicate
- genome-attributes-viewer: simplified app setup
- multiple code small fixes and improvements

=== 1.1 ===
- fix package requirements specification
- fix detection of already deleted node

=== 1.0 ===
- version described in the paper

=== 0.1 ===
- initial alpha release
