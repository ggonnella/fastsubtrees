- (1) NCBI taxonomy will be loaded from the dump files
- (2) Example application: Taxonomy names will be used as attribute (scientific name' column = YES)
      - one will provide scripts that:
        - construct the tree
        - loads the names as attributes
- (3) Example application: like prost-db-viewer but stripped down:
      - no comparison, only one attribute
      - no attribute metadata
      - attribute will be just genome size
      - one will provide scripts that:
        - construct the tree
        - loads the genome sizes from a TSV file as attributes
