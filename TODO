Update README.md:
- “Library API”:
  - move the text under “Library API” to a new file called manuals/api.md
  - Update the information adding the documentation of the newer functionality added to it
- “Scripts”:
  - move the text under “Scripts” to a new file called manuals/cli.md
  - Briefly document all the scripts
- after the introduction text:
  - explain the attributes functionality 
  - shortly explain that the main purpose is to handle the NCBI taxonomy tree
  - state that the code can be run using the library API or using the scripts
    and link the two files

Changes to the code:
- The attribute files must be updated too, when nodes are deleted or added
- Can the adding of an entire subtree be made smarter? (e.g. making updates for the entire subtree at once, instead of updating for each node separately)

Probably invalid/unacceptable inputs (what happens? If error msg they should be meaningful; if other behaviour then it should be specified; anyway these cases should be added to the test suite):
- Node “0” (do we really need to forbid it?)
- Circular
- No root node (no node where children_id ==parent_id)
- Multiple roots
- Some parent_id which is not referring to any node in the tree
- repeated node_id

Idea for node names:
- String names of the nodes could be added in form of an attribute file
  this allows to generalize the use to where the nodes are not numbers
  e.g. assign IDs automatically if the input are not integers
