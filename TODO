High priority:
[ ] fixes to the interface of `add_node`, `add_subtree`, `get_treedata`,
`get_coords`, `update_subtree_sizes` and `delete_nodes`:
  - these are instance methods; self is the instance, there is no need for
    further Tree objects called `node_tree` or `tree`
  - loading the tree from file and saving to file after modification must be done
    in the calling code (e.g. scripts under bin and tests) and not from these methods
[ ] fix `fastsubtrees-attributes-construct` so that is not based on the database
  but uses the abstract system used by `fastsubtrees-construct`
  (i.e. one command line parameter is the name of a Python module
  - which shall define a given function, specificied in the help message - and another
  commmand line parameter is the the name of a file containing configuration information
  which is made available to the abovementioned Python module)
[ ] since there is no state information stored in the instances of
"FinaleAttributeGenerator" (and the name of the class is quite confusing too),
we do not need a class at all in that module

Mid priority:
[ ] attribute files must be updated, when nodes are deleted or added:
    - plan what changes are needed in each case (adding a leaf, adding an internal node,
    removing a leaf, removing an internal node)
    - implement them in API methods
    - in the scripts which add/remove nodes: the names of the attribute files
    which must be modified can be passed as optional parameters
[ ] Handle invalid input:
    - Make test cases which provide invalid inputs for each of the operations
      - Node “0” (3 examples: A) "1 1" "0 1" B) "1 1" "1 0" C) just "0 0")
      - Repeated node_ids (e.g. "1 1", "2 1", "3 1", "2 3", thereby 2 is repeated)
      - No root node (no node where children_id ==parent_id) e.g.
        (eg. "2 1", "3 1", "4 3")
      - Multiple root nodes
        (eg. "1 1", "2 1", "3 2", "4 4" 1 and 4 are both roots)
      - parent_id not referring to any node in the tree
        (eg. "1 1" "2 1", "3 1", "4 5", 5 is not defined)
      - adding a subtree with a node which already exists
        (can be the root of the new subtree or any other node of it)
      - removing a node which does not exist
      - re-adding a node which was deleted before
        (since too complicated to handle)
    - Catch invalid inputs (and create meaningful error messages, exception shall be of the
    class `Error` defined in the library error.py file) as much as
    possible without impacting the perfomance
    - Note: If some invalid input cannot be checked upon for performance reasons or because
    the implementation takes too much time, such cases must be documented

Lower priority:
[ ] Make adding of an entire subtree smarter by making place for entire subtree at once
    instead of repeat updating the tree for each node iteratively
[ ] add ``if line[0] == "#": continue`` to the tree construction from csv to
    support comment/header lines in the files
[ ] Finish the documentation:
  [ ] API manual:
    - Update the information adding the documentation of the newer functionality added to it
  [ ] CLI manual:
    - Briefly document the function of all the scripts
  [ ] README:
    - add hyperlinks to the API manual and CLI manual files
[ ] Can we handle attributes which are strings? This can be used for non-integer
    node names; i.e. string node names would be stored as attributes
    this allows to generalize the use of the library to cases where the nodes are not
    "consecutive positive integer numbers"; numerical IDs could be assigned
    automatically in such cases
